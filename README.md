## üîç Problem It Solves

Modern algorithmic and high-frequency trading (HFT) systems need:
- Real-time decision making (microseconds to milliseconds)
- AI-driven market insights
- Scalable, fault-tolerant architecture

This system solves those problems using a modular, pluggable C++ infrastructure.
